Perhaps an element of randomness could be introduced, with a random portion of the population acting against the player's chosen option. In addition, the mode in which the player resists the government's policies could also be expanded upon, since resistance comes in various degrees (ignoring lockdown rules, not wearing masks, protests etc)."
